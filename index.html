         <p style="">Fortunately for me, my career has both afforded me and provided me countless opportunities to explore the best of food not only in New York City, but around the world. My work has taken me as far as London, Mumbai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Taipei, as well as cities closer to home like Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Houston.</p>
